**III- Environmental Impacts of Tourism**

**Answer the questions:**
1.  **When do environmental impacts of tourism occur?**
    Environmental impacts of tourism occur when the level of visitor use is greater than the environment's ability to cope with this use.
2.  **What impacts does tourism cause in an area?**
    Tourism can cause soil erosion, increased pollution, discharges into the sea, natural habitat loss, increased pressure on endangered species, and heightened vulnerability to forest fires.
3.  **What effects does the tourism industry leave on water sources?**
    The tourism industry overuses water resources, leading to shortages, degradation of supplies, increased wastewater, and water scarcity (especially from golf courses).

**III- Environmental Impacts of Tourism (Continued)**
4.  **Why are golf courses harmful to the environment?**
    Golf courses are harmful because they require enormous amounts of water daily, depleting fresh water resources and potentially causing water scarcity.
5.  **Why can tourism create great pressure on local resources?**
    High tourist numbers, especially in peak season, drastically increase demand for local resources (energy, food, water) which may be in short supply.
6.  **Why do some trails have the nickname of “ Coca-Cola trail" or 'Toilet paper trail"?**
    Because trekking tourists generate lots of waste and leave behind garbage like drink cans/bottles and toilet paper along the trails.
